# Haskell Type Error in List Sorting

This repository demonstrates a common type error encountered in Haskell when working with lists and sorting functions.  The `bug.hs` file contains code that attempts to sort a list with elements of mixed types (Ints and Strings). The `bugSolution.hs` file illustrates how to correct the error by ensuring type homogeneity within the list.
