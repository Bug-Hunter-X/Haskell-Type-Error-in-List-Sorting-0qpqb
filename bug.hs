```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNumbers = sort numbers
  print sortedNumbers
```
This code snippet intends to sort a list of numbers using the `Data.List.sort` function. While this seems straightforward, a subtle error can arise if the list contains elements of different types. For example, if we added a string to the list, the compiler would complain that it can't compare different types (like `Int` and `String`).
